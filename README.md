# 🍎 macOS Web Clone

A browser-based clone of the macOS desktop environment built using **React + Vite + SCSS**.
This project simulates the look and basic behavior of Apple's macOS interface inside a web browser.

The goal of this project is to practice **frontend engineering, UI/UX design, component architecture, and state management** by recreating a real operating system interface.

## 🚀 Live Experience

The application recreates a desktop-like environment:

* Desktop wallpaper
* Dock with applications
* Openable windows
* Draggable components
* Menu bar

It behaves like a mini operating system inside the browser.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

I wanted to go beyond simple CRUD websites.
So I tried to recreate a **real-world complex UI system** (an OS interface).
This project helped me understand:

* Component reusability
* Event handling
* UI state control
* Window management logic
